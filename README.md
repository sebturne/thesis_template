# thesis_template

A repository containing a LaTeX template with which to write a Ph.D. thesis. Start by reading the abstract of the .pdf file, and then get stuck into the source files in the .zip folder. This template was prepared using Overleaf, and hence it's probably best to edit it there too, though it should work anywhere.
